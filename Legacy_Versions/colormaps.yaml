# =============================
# COLORMAP NAMING CONVENTION
# =============================
# Reverse colormaps are denoted with '_r' suffix
# Examples:
#   viridis    - Dark to light progression
#   viridis_r  - Light to dark progression
#   coolwarm   - Blue (low) to red (high)
#   coolwarm_r - Red (low) to blue (high)
#
# Usage in config.yaml:
#   colormap:
#     name: viridis_r    # Light to dark
#     name: viridis      # Dark to light
#
# This allows you to choose the direction that best fits your data interpretation
